What is Vcash?
---
Vcash is a decentralized internet currency that enables you to send money to anyone in the world, instantly, and at almost no cost.

Vcash features include [Peercoin](https://github.com/ppcoin/ppcoin) PoS, [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) PoW consensus, a UDP layer, an off-chain transaction lock voting system called ZeroTime, an Incentive Reward voting system, and a client-side blending system called ChainBlender.

[The docs](https://docs.vcash.info/) [(source)](https://github.com/openvcash/docs.vcash.info), and [the whitepapers.](https://github.com/openvcash/papers)  
Read [common issues](docs/COMMON_ISSUES.md) if you're having problems related to the features of the coin itself.

Building from source
---
**WARNING: read [BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md) before attempting to build from source.**  
[The list of dependencies can be found here.](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md)

There are currently two ways to build the source code: [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [Boost.](http://www.boost.org/build/)

CMake relies on the dependencies to be installed normally, while Boost-build requires you to build and compile dependencies into the [vcash/deps](deps) folder.

#### Windows
1. Install [the dependencies](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md) to their normal locations.
2. Download and extract the newest [Source code (zip).](https://github.com/openvcash/vcash/releases/latest)
3. Setting [installation prefixes](docs/BUILDING.md) is recommend, but you can just run CMake on `vcash/CMakeLists.txt` to start the build process.
4. Run [NMake](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/nmake-reference) on the Makefile generated by CMake.  

#### Linux
Example of the **Ubuntu** build process.

1. Install [the dependencies](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md).
2. Download the newest [Source code (tar.gz)](https://github.com/openvcash/vcash/releases/latest) to your `~/Downloads` folder.
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake boost-defaults db-defaults openssl
```
3. Setting [installation prefixes](docs/BUILDING.md) is recommend, but otherwise you can just run the following commands from your terminal...
```
tar -xzf ~/Downloads/vcash-*.tar.gz
cd ~/Downloads/vcash-*/
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
make install
```

When finished, you should be able to run `vcashd` from your terminal.  

**Arch-based**  
[![The AUR PKGBUILD](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/vcash.svg)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vcash/) is available, which builds and installs the source code from the latest release.

If you don't know how to install something from the Arch User Repository, [read this Arch wiki post](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers) or [this post on the forums.](https://forum.vcash.info/d/56-arch-linux-aur-pkgbuild-s)

#### Mac
1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), the macOS package manager.
2. Follow the setup guide on Homebrew's website, then use it to install [the dependencies.](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md)
3. Download the newest [Source code (tar.gz)](https://github.com/openvcash/vcash/releases/latest) to your `~/Downloads` folder.
4. Setting [installation prefixes](docs/BUILDING.md) is recommend, but otherwise you can just run the following commands from your terminal...
```
tar -xzf ~/Downloads/vcash-*.tar.gz
cd ~/Downloads/vcash-*/
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
make install
```
